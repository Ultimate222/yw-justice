    <div class="collapsible-content">
        <p>Youth for Women’s Justice (YWJ) is a high school-driven initiative aimed at raising awareness about women’s rights and advocating against violence and discrimination toward women and girls in Fiji. Founded by young leaders passionate about social justice, YWJ seeks to inform, empower, and inspire Fijian women and girls to stand up for their rights, recognize signs of abuse, and access the help they need. By providing valuable resources, connections to local helplines, and real stories from women advocates, YWJ aspires to foster a supportive and informed community where women’s voices are heard and valued.</p>

        Why Focus On Fiji? <span class="arrow">▼</span>
    </h2>
    <div class="collapsible-content">
        <p><b>Why Fiji?</b>  While women’s rights are a global issue, certain regions face unique social and cultural challenges that hinder gender equality. In Fiji, many women and girls experience violence, harassment, and societal pressures that keep them from recognizing their value and rights. Traditional norms often prevent open discussions about abuse, making it difficult for those affected to seek help or realize that their situation is not acceptable. YWJ recognizes the importance of focusing on these specific cultural contexts and aims to provide resources tailored to the Fijian community’s unique needs, challenges, and language.</p>
        <p>Additionally, the remoteness of certain Fijian communities can limit access to support networks, legal protections, and crisis services. YWJ wants to bridge this gap by creating a digital platform where women and girls across Fiji can access information, find helplines, and connect with a supportive network that understands their background and struggles.</p>
