      <h2>Why Focus on Fiji?</h2>
      <p>
        Fiji faces unique challenges, including gender-based violence, economic inequality,
        and a lack of access to educational resources for women. YWJ is committed to addressing
        these issues by partnering with local communities, organizations, and leaders to effect change.
