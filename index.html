            <h2>About YWJ</h2>
            <p>
                <b>Youth for Women’s Justice (YWJ)</b> is a high school-driven initiative aimed at raising awareness about 
                women’s rights and advocating against violence and discrimination toward women and girls in Fiji. Founded 
                by young leaders passionate about social justice, YWJ seeks to inform, empower, and inspire Fijian women 
                and girls to stand up for their rights, recognize signs of abuse, and access the help they need. By providing 
                valuable resources, connections to local helplines, and real stories from women advocates, YWJ aspires to 
                foster a supportive and informed community where women’s voices are heard and valued.

        <!-- Why Focus on Fiji Section -->
        <section id="why-fiji">
            <h2>Why Focus on Fiji?</h2>
            <p>
                While women’s rights are a global issue, certain regions face unique social and cultural challenges that 
                hinder gender equality. In Fiji, many women and girls experience violence, harassment, and societal pressures 
                that keep them from recognizing their value and rights. Traditional norms often prevent open discussions 
                about abuse, making it difficult for those affected to seek help or realize that their situation is not 
                acceptable. YWJ recognizes the importance of focusing on these specific cultural contexts and aims to provide 
                resources tailored to the Fijian community’s unique needs, challenges, and language.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, the remoteness of certain Fijian communities can limit access to support networks, legal 
                protections, and crisis services. YWJ wants to bridge this gap by creating a digital platform where women 
                and girls across Fiji can access information, find helplines, and connect with a supportive network that 
                understands their background and struggles.
